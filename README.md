# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

🔧 QUICK SUGGESTIONS TO IMPROVE YOUR WEBSITE
Refactor text hierarchy — Bold, large font for headlines. Your current ones are too polite. Make the headings command attention.

Add clear CTA buttons — Like “See Work” or “Get a Quote” below each section.

Simplify portfolio previews — Remove grayscale boxes; show real, clickable screenshots.

Trim About text — Your current writeup is too CV-like. Focus on value for the client.

Add results-driven lines — Like “helped X client improve conversions by Y%”.

Improve testimonials section — Add even 1-2 short quotes from past clients for social proof
